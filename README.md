## Welcome, I'm Antoine!ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’¬ I'm a developer that mainly focuses on *Minecraft Bedrock Edition* softwares such as *[PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP)* & *[MiNET](https://github.com/NiclasOlofsson/MiNET)*. I love creating APIs and libraries to optimize servers. I also do C#, Java & Python related projects. I am a self-taught developer and I enjoy learning about new technologies. I've worked on Pigraid (was the owner) & SavageSMP network as developer.

### Why **Pig{project}**?
This is just an homage to my old network called Pigraid Network, this is when I really started to like coding.
